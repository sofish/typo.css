## What is clean-css?

Clean-css is a [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) library for minifying CSS files.
It does the same job as YUI Compressor's CSS minifier, but much faster thanks
to many speed optimizations and node.js' V8 engine.


## Usage

### What are the requirements?

```
node.js 0.6.0+ on UN*X (fully tested on OS X 10.6+ and CentOS)
node.js 0.8.0+ on Windows
```

### How to install clean-css?

```
npm install clean-css
```

### How to use clean-css CLI?

Clean-css accepts the following command line arguments (please make sure
you use `<source-file>` as the very last argument to avoid potential issues):

```
cleancss [options] <source-file>

-h, --help                  Output usage information
-v, --version               Output the version number
-e, --remove-empty          Remove empty declarations (e.g. a{})
-b, --keep-line-breaks      Keep line breaks
--s0                        Remove all special comments (i.e. /*! special comment */)
--s1                        Remove all special comments but the first one
-r, --root [root-path]      Set a root path to which resolve absolute @import rules
-o, --output [output-file]  Use [output-file] as output instead of STDOUT
```

#### Examples:

To minify a **public.css** file into **public-min.css** do:

```
cleancss -o public-min.css public.css
```

To minify the same **public.css** into the standard output skip the `-o` parameter:

```
cleancss public.css
```

More likely you would like to concatenate a couple of files.
If you are on a Unix-like system:

```bash
cat one.css two.css three.css | cleancss -o merged-and-minified.css
```

On Windows:

```bat
type one.css two.css three.css | cleancss -o merged-and-minified.css
```

Or even gzip the result at once:

```bash
cat one.css two.css three.css | cleancss | gzip -9 -c > merged-minified-and-gzipped.css.gz
```

### How to use clean-css programmatically?

```js
var cleanCSS = require('clean-css');
var source = "a{font-weight:bold;}";
var minimized = cleanCSS.process(source);
```

Process method accepts a hash as a second parameter, i.e.,
`cleanCSS.process(source, options)` with the following options available:

* `keepSpecialComments` - `*` for keeping all (default), `1` for keeping first one, `0` for removing all
* `keepBreaks` - whether to keep line breaks (default is false)
* `removeEmpty` - whether to remove empty elements (default is false)
* `debug` - turns on debug mode measuring time spent on cleaning up
  (run `npm run bench` to see example)

### What are the clean-css' dev commands?

First clone the source, then run:

* `npm run bench` for clean-css benchmarks (see [test/bench.js](/test/bench.js) for details)
* `npm run check` to check JS sources with [JSHint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/)
* `npm test` for the test suite

### How do you preserve a comment block?

Use the `/*!` notation instead of the standard one `/*`:

```css
/*!
  Important comments included in minified output.
*/
```
